# remark-slug

**Stability: Legacy**.
This package is no longer recommended for use.
It’s still covered by semantic-versioning guarantees and not yet deprecated,
but use of this package should be avoided.
Please use `remark-rehype` to move from remark (markdown) to rehype (HTML)
and then replace `remark-slug` with
[`rehype-slug`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-slug/blob/main/readme.md).
